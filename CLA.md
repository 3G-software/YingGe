# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## YingGe (影阁) Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to YingGe. In order to
clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions
from any person or entity, the project maintainer must have a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each
Contributor. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as
well as the protection of the project and its users.

## Agreement

By submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing to this project,
you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

- **"You"** (or **"Your"**) shall mean the copyright owner or legal
  entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this
  Agreement. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and
  all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
  common control with that entity are considered to be a single
  Contributor.

- **"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship,
  including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is
  intentionally submitted by You to this project for inclusion in, or
  documentation of, the project.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the project maintainer and to recipients of
software distributed by the project maintainer a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
derivative works.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the project maintainer and to recipients of
software distributed by the project maintainer a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent
claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with
the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

### 4. Representations

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create
that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received
permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that
Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to this
project.

### 5. Original Work

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.
You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
details of any third-party license or other restriction of which You
are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
Contributions.

### 6. Commercial Licensing

You acknowledge and agree that the project maintainer reserves the
right to offer the project (including Your Contributions) under
alternative licenses, including commercial licenses. The current
open-source license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) does not restrict the project
maintainer from dual-licensing the project.

### 7. No Support Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except
to the extent You desire to provide support. Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.
